                            Front End was a great fit

                        <p>
                            The projects and assignments I completed in the Frontend course at Sundusgårdens
                            folkhögskola greatly developed my skills in:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>HTML5</li>
                            <li>CSS3</li>
                            <li>JavaScript</li>
                            <li>Figma</li>
                            <li>Modern design libraries</li>
                            <li>Git/GitHub</li>
                            <li>Modern frameworks</li>
                            <li>Agile work</li>
                        </ul>
                        Now I am able to design fully responsive web
                        pages using Html , css ,JavaScript and Modern
                        design libraries and frameworks.

                        <p>In this project, I used everything I learned about responsive design,
                            Sass, and SEO. Additionally, I used JavaScript to create an overlay
                            navigation for small screens.

                            In this project, I created a personal website for my resume that is responsive across all
                            devices. I used the Bootstrap framework, and I made some adjustments using Sass.
